# Advanced Calculator
## Summary
Advanced calculator that is capable of solving a variety of mathematical problems from most user inputs.. Currently under development so many planned features are not implemented yet. The primary goal of this project is to improve my knowledge of programming in Java while simultaneously improving the strength of my portfolio.

## Planned Features
- *Support for parenthesis, including multiple parenthesis within the same equation* ‚îÅ **Completed on 1/11/2022**
- *Support for exponents, including equations within exponents and stacked exponents*
- *Support for equations with variables, including solving for one or multiple variables*


## Update History
**1/11/2022** - Support for parenthesis has been added after a structural redesign of the code. The three primary objects are now subclasses of one object, which allows for other proccesses to occur that ultiamtely decrease the amount of code needed for this implementation.

**1/15/2022** - Adjusted code to account for standard Java conventions including the use of setters and getters, final variables where applicable, and adjusted naming conventions for variables.

**1/19/2022** - Implemented error detection and error messaging when users enter improperly formatted equations. Other small adjustments to improve clarity and conciseness of the code.
